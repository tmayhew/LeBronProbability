$\text{Pr}(PTS = 27) = \frac{\text{Observed 27-Point Games}}{\text{Total Observed Games}} = \frac{72}{1310} = 0.05496$

$\text{Pr}(TRB = 7) = \frac{\text{Observed 7-Rebound Games}}{\text{Total Observed Games}} = \frac{184}{1310} = 0.140458$

$\text{Pr}(AST = 7) = \frac{\text{Observed 7-Assist Games}}{\text{Total Observed Games}} = \frac{191}{1310} = 0.14580$

$\text{Pr}(PTS = 27, TRB = 7, AST = 7) = (0.05496) \times (0.140458) \times (0.14580) = 0.001126$

$(0.9988744)^{1310} = 0.228706$
